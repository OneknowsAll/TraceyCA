            "In general, a sustainable urban forest is a forest in which the trees are of different ages and diverse with species well-suited to site conditions, and that are insect and disease resistant and low maintenance. A tree population meeting these criteria is sustainable, resilient, and produces maximum social, economic, and ecological benefits for the community.",

They do not arise at random, but result from a community-wide commitment to their creation and management.  Obtaining the commitment of a broad community, of numerous constituencies, cannot be dictated or legislated. It must arise out of compromise and respect.'<br> -- Clark, et. al., A Model of Urban Forest Sustainability</div>",
