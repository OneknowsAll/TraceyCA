            <ul>
                <li>The theoretical maximum canopy for the city is 60% UTC.</li>
                <li>Sammamish directly manages 2,193 acres of public property with 32% UTC</li>
                <ul><li>Tree canopy in parks represents 6% of the city’s total tree cover.</li></ul>
                <li>The UTC in Neighboring Cities for context include:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hello  (2006) - 51%</li>
                    <li>My Name (2011) - 44%</li>
                    <li>Is (2010) - 41%</li>
                    <li>Bob (2016) - 28%</li>
                </ul>
                
            </ul>
            According to U.S. Forest Service Research Forester, Greg McPherson (AmericanForests.org), canopy goals, are best developed for specific cities and should consider constraints to creating canopy such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Development densities (i.e., dense development patterns with more impervious surfaces have less opportunity for cover);</li>
                <li>Land use patterns (i.e., residential areas may have more opportunity for canopy than commercial areas, but canopy cover tends to be less in residential areas of disadvantaged communities versus wealthy ones);</li>
                <li>Ordinances (i.e., parking lot shade ordinances promote cover over some impervious areas); and Climate (i.e., canopy cover in desert cities is often less than tropical cities).”</li>
            </ul>
